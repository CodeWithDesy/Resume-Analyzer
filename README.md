- ## 🤔 Why Resume Analyzer?  

The hiring process can be time-consuming and subjective. Resume Analyzer is designed to act as a *supportive tool* for recruiters and job seekers alike:  

- ⏱ *Saves Time* – Quickly scans resumes against job descriptions.  
- ⚖ *Reduces Bias* – Focuses on skill matching rather than personal factors.  
- 📢 *Provides Feedback* – Highlights missing skills and extra strengths.  
- 🚀 *Flexible* – Works across both tech and non-tech roles.  
The goal is not to replace human judgment, but to make the hiring process *faster, fairer, and more insightful*.
